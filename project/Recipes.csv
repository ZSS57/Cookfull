That's it! Fried eggs are a simple and versatile dish that requires minimal ingredients. Adjust the quantity of eggs and seasonings based on your preferences and the number of servings you want to make. Enjoy your delicious fried eggs!","Here are two methods to prepare fried eggs:

    Simple Method:
        Heat a small frying pan and add the cooking fat of your choice (enough to coat the bottom of the pan).
        Carefully crack the egg into the pan, ensuring not to break the yolk. Season with salt.
        Once the egg white starts to set, pierce the yolk gently with a fork. This will help it cook evenly.
        If the pan is not non-stick, transfer the fried egg onto a plate. Serve it with bread, dipping it into the hot fat. Enjoy!

    Enhanced Method:
        In a small frying pan or saucepan, melt a teaspoon of butter or margarine and add a tablespoon of sour cream.
        Once the sour cream starts to simmer, carefully crack two eggs into the pan, side by side. Sprinkle them lightly with salt and top with grated Tilsit cheese or any other dry cheese.
        Avoid stirring the eggs. Allow the egg whites to set slowly while you eagerly anticipate their deliciousness.
        Once the egg whites are fully cooked, remove the pan from heat and serve the eggs directly from the pan or transfer them to a plate. Eggs cooked in a pan or skillet tend to be more flavorful."
,,,,"    In a frying pan, melt a teaspoon of bacon fat or cooking fat over medium heat.
    Add 3-4 slices of bacon, bacon fat, sausage, or ham to the pan. Cook until the bacon starts to render its fat and becomes slightly translucent, and the sausage or ham begins to brown.
    Flip the bacon or sausage slices to the other side and create space for the eggs.
    Crack 2 eggs into the pan, taking care not to break the yolks. Season with salt and pepper.
    Cook until the egg whites are set, but the yolks are still runny or cooked to your desired doneness. If you prefer well-done eggs, you can cook them longer.
    Once the eggs are cooked, remove them from the pan immediately.
    Garnish with chopped chives or parsley if desired.
    Serve the fried eggs with bacon, sausage, or ham alongside toast or bread.

Feel free to adjust the quantities and cooking times based on your preferences. Enjoy your delicious fried eggs with your choice of sides!"

,,Scrambled eggs:,"    2-3 eggs

    Optional: Water or milk (1 tablespoon)

Note: You can also add additional ingredients of your choice, such as cheese, herbs, vegetables, or cooked meats, to enhance the flavor of the scrambled eggs.","However, we believe that 2 eggs (exceptionally 3) are a completely satisfying amount to appease the appetite, especially when accompanied by a portion of potatoes (fried or boiled), a slice of bread with butter, not to mention green salad, tomatoes, or cucumber salad.

Scrambled eggs can be prepared perfectly just as easily as they can be ruined. They should be moist and, depending on our preference, almost runny or with a thick creamy consistency. Overcooked eggs are dry, ""grainy,"" and devoid of the characteristic aroma that is one of the important charms of this dish.

Always fry scrambled eggs over low heat!

2 eggs are the ""golden measure."" We crack them into a saucepan or onto a plate and beat them lightly with a fork until the resulting ""emulsion"" starts to froth slightly on the surface. The more thoroughly we beat the eggs, the more delicate and ""fluffy"" the scrambled eggs will be.

In a frying pan, melt a heaping teaspoon of butter, margarine, or lard. Butter gives the scrambled eggs a specially mild aroma. The fat should be hot (but never brown the butter). Pour the lightly salted eggs onto the pan (overly salty scrambled eggs are dreadful) and, as they begin to set, mix them with a fork to ensure even cooking. Adding a tablespoon of water (preferably mineral water) or milk to the eggs before beating them will increase the volume and make them even more delicate.    2 teaspoons of grated cheese (added just before pouring the eggs onto the pan)
    Optional: 1 tablespoon of cooked peas, finely chopped sausage or ham, or sautéed mushrooms
    Finely chopped chives or spring onions for garnishing
    Serve with fried potatoes and pickles for a complete meal
    Optional: A few leaves of green salad (except in winter months) for serving

These additional ingredients will enhance the flavor, nutritional value, and appearance of the scrambled eggs."

.","    In a porcelain bowl or mortar and pestle, start by adding a few drops of lemon juice or vinegar and a pinch of salt.

    Next, add the raw egg yolk to the bowl.

    Begin whisking or stirring the mixture in one direction only. You can use a spoon, a wooden pestle, or a porcelain pestle like those used in pharmacies for grinding ointments.

    As you stir, gradually add a few drops of oil at a time. It's important that the egg yolk and oil are not too cold to prevent the mayonnaise from splitting. Room temperature ingredients work best.

    Continue adding the oil, a few drops at a time, while continuously stirring in one direction. Another person can help by slowly pouring the oil while you stir.

    If the mayonnaise starts to separate or ""curdle,"" it means it has emulsified incorrectly. To fix this, add a tablespoon of hot water while continuing to stir. This should help bring the mixture back together.

    Once you've achieved the desired consistency, adjust the taste by adding more salt, sugar, or lemon juice/vinegar if needed.

    If the mayonnaise is too thick, you can thin it out by adding a tablespoon of sour cream or, as a last resort, water.

    Taste and adjust the seasoning as desired.

    Your homemade mayonnaise sauce is now ready to be used in your favorite dishes or as a dipping sauce.

Remember to store the mayonnaise in a sealed container in the refrigerator and consume it within a few days."
